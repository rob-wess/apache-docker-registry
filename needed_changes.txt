- Add httpd-tools rpm to the install_docker_ce role. Currently, it uses yum

- Update installer_main.sh to handle previous versions of ansible. If installed, ansible should not be less than 2.8. Add logic to handle if it is...
  
CURRENT STATUS
The scripts and plays deploy successfully. However, the last task in deploy_secure_registry/tasks/main.yml, doesn't execute with the variables. Its supposed to echo {{ APACHE_USER }} and {{ APACHE_PASSWORD }} in auth/htpad.htpasswd but instead echoes literally (cat the file to see '{{ APACHE_USER }}:hash '). 

After the installer runs, the user still needs to su to docker, cd into the home directory and run 'docker-compose up -d' to start the two containers. 

They will also need to test authentication by running 'docker login {{ registry_fqdn }}:5043 with the apache username/password. 
The httpd.conf also requires a group named 'developer' to push/put/delete/patch but there is no script/play to create the apache gorup file.
